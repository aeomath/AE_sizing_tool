"""
This code defines the variables used in the aircraft sizing project, Those of the varaiable used
to design aircraft. Once the aircraft is fixed, they are fixed.
- `Aircraft` class represents the aircraft and contains nested classes for different components.
- `Design` class represents the design variables of the aircraft.
